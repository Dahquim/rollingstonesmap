Visualization developed using *reveal.js* - http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/ and *cartodb.js* - http://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb.js/tree/develop

All the data is hosted on *Cartodb* - http://cartodb.com and comes from *Wikipedia* - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stones_concerts

All you need to run this locally is to download the zip file and run the app in a local server.

We hope you enjoy it.
